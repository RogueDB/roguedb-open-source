# Overview

This directory contains all code referenced and used in the creation of blog articles. For organization purposes, additional directories have been created that match the high level categories on the website:

- Software Foundations: `blogs/software_foundations/`
- Software Architecture: `blogs/software_architecture/`
- Benchmarking: `blogs/benchmarking/`
- Performance Optimizations: `blogs/performance_optimizations/`
- DevOps: `blogs/devops/`

The blog's url gets created as a sub-directory in its respective category to enhance organization for easy tracking and accounting for cases of multiple files per article. An example may be: `blogs/benchmarking/grpc-throughput-effects-of-batching/` containing all files for the article at `roguedb.com/blog/grpc-throughput-effects-of-batching`.
